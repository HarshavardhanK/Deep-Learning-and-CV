 October 30: Completed Week 1 of ML Stanford, along with gradient descent implementation in python

Nov 1-3: Completed Week 2 of Andrew NG, exercise was completed in Week 1

*Studying for end semester labs and exams. Need to pass lmao*

November 24-26: Completed Week 3 of Andrew NG along with implementation of logistic regression and plotting decision regions as asked in the assignment.

November 29-20: Completed Week 4 of Andrew NG theory

December 1: Implemented feed forward algorithm in C++ || Edit: also in python

December 2-4: Completed Week 5 of Andrew NG

December 4-6: Implemented a neural network to classify handwritten digits. 

Used Yan LeCunn’s MNIST instead of the one provided by Andrew NG since I don’t have MATLAB or Octave to export the .m to CSV files. 60k training examples, 10k testing examples. 99.2% accuracy. 100 units in hidden layer, 100 in mini batches for stochastic gradient descent
